The issue you have is that elasticsearch is not being started as a daemon (server). Instead you starting it as you would a normal program. Therefore when you stop your SSH session, the program stops running.

In order to get elasticsearch to start when the server itself is rebooted, you need to add elasticsearch to the server startup.

You didn't say which operating system you are running on the server. Let's assume it's a Debian (eg Ubuntu) system), you must create a file that you can place in the directory /etc/init.d.

I have copied the file from my own server below. You may already have it. Look for the file /etc/init.d/elasticsearch

$ more /etc/init.d/elasticsearch 
Once you have the file you can run the command

sudo update-rc.d elasticsearch defaults 95 10
This will "install" elasticsearch as a service.

To start and stop the service, you can run the commands :

sudo  service elasticsearch start
sudo  service elasticsearch stop
