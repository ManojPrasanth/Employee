#Example
# Logrotate file for /var/log/solr.log

/home/manojprasanths/solr-7.1.0/example/cloud/node2/logs/*log {
        su root			//its mandatory if log file is not in root dir
        daily			//its exception
        missingok		//if file doesnt exists it must not through error
        rotate 4			//last 4 rotated log files are kept and remaining are removed
        compress		//its exception if files needs to be compress in gzip format
        size 5K			//its rotates if files are > 5k 
        notifempty		//it doesnt rotate a file if its empty

        create 644 manojprasanths manojprasanths
				//it is used to create a new log empty file after rotating
        #prerotate/postrotate	//it is exception runs the code within it before are after rotating

# Logrotate
If you are a System Administrator handling large number of servers and systems that generate high volume of log files, then logrotate utility will help you by saving the disk space to avoid potential damage. It is designed to ease administration of systems that generate large numbers of log files. It allows automatic rotation, compression, removal, and mailing of log files. Each log file may be handled daily, weekly, monthly, or when it grows too large.

su root:This is required when running log files which are not in root dir 

daily: log rotation interval.

weekly: This is the log rotation interval weekly basis.

rotate 4: Logrotate will keep 4 weeks of log files backup.

create: New empty will be created after rotating the old ones.

compress: the log files will be compressed with gzip method.

delaycompress:  Postpone compression of the previous log file to the next rotation cycle. This only has effect when used in combination with compress. It can be used when some program cannot be told to close its logfile and thus might continue writing to the previous log file for some time.

missingok: avoids the output error if any log file missing.

notifempty: do not rotate if the file empty.

size 100M: logs will be rotated if they reach 100MB size.

create 0755 sk sk: creates new file with permission 755 where owner is sk and group is sk.

mail address:   When a log is rotated out of existence, it is mailed to address. If no mail should be generated by a particular log, the nomail directive may be used.

Automate Logrotation with Cron

Automate the logrotation process using the cron file /etc/cron.daily/logrotate. The logroatation will be performed daily.
For automate logrotation the config file must be saved in the  /etc/cron.daily/file , if it needs to be rotated daily.(orelse cron.weekly,cron.hourly,cron.monthly)
